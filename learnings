data model in models, we use it in controllers.
db -> connecting to database.
services -> interact with the database.
controllers -> logics in side the routes

create a readme.md file to docs the /users/register endpoint with decription and status code, also write how the data is required in the endpoint

we are using a middleware to check if a user is loggedin or not.
req.cookies.token to check the set cookie.

for users who log out, create a model 'blacklist'

enhances security by ensuring that the token is invalidated both on the client 
side (by clearing the cookie) and on the server side (by blacklisting the token).
